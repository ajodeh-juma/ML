Tree ensembles

Ensemble learning methods combine a set of models to produce an estimator that has better predictive performance
that its individual components.
 A random forest is a collection of decision trees that have been trained on randomly selected subsets of the
training instances and explanatory variables.

Random forests are less prone to overfitting than decision trees because:
1. No single tree can learn from all of the instances and explanatory variables.
2. No single tree memorize all of the noise in the representation.
